## üéØ AI ROI Calculator

### Purpose
Calculate the financial return on investment for AI tool implementations in your organization.

### Inputs Needed
- **Current process costs** (time + salary)
- **AI tool costs** (subscription + setup)
- **Time savings percentage**
- **Number of employees affected**
- **Implementation timeframe**

### Sample Calculation

#### Scenario: Customer Service AI Chatbot

**Current State:**
- 5 customer service reps
- Average salary: $50,000/year
- Handle 1,000 tickets/month
- Average resolution time: 15 minutes

**With AI Implementation:**
- AI handles 60% of tickets automatically
- Remaining tickets take 10 minutes (improved tools)
- AI chatbot cost: $500/month
- Setup and training: $5,000 one-time

**Calculation:**
```
Current Cost:
- 5 reps √ó $50,000 = $250,000/year
- 1,000 tickets √ó 15 min = 250 hours/month
- Cost per ticket: $20.83

With AI:
- AI handles 600 tickets automatically
- Human reps handle 400 tickets √ó 10 min = 66.7 hours/month
- AI cost: $500/month + $5,000 setup
- Annual AI cost: $11,000

Savings:
- Time saved: 183.3 hours/month
- Salary savings: $91,650/year
- Net savings: $91,650 - $11,000 = $80,650/year
- ROI: 733% (first year)
```

### Quick ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual AI Costs) / Annual AI Costs √ó 100
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Savings Calculator

### Purpose
Calculate time savings from AI automation across different use cases.

### Common Time Savings by Task

#### **Content Creation**
- **Blog writing**: 40-60% time reduction
- **Social media posts**: 70-80% time reduction  
- **Email responses**: 50-70% time reduction
- **Report generation**: 60-80% time reduction

#### **Data Analysis**
- **Excel data processing**: 80-90% time reduction
- **Report creation**: 60-70% time reduction

#### **Administrative Tasks**
- **Meeting summaries**: 90% time reduction
- **Calendar scheduling**: 80% time reduction
- **Document formatting**: 70% time reduction
- **Email management**: 60% time reduction

### Sample Calculation: Marketing Team

**Current State:**
- 3 marketing professionals
- Average salary: $70,000/year
- Spend 10 hours/week on content creation

**With AI Tools:**
- 60% time savings on content creation
- AI tools cost: $300/month total

**Calculation:**
```
Time Savings:
- 3 people √ó 10 hours/week √ó 60% = 18 hours/week saved
- 18 hours √ó 52 weeks = 936 hours/year saved
- Hourly rate: $70,000 √∑ 2,080 hours = $33.65/hour
- Value of saved time: 936 √ó $33.65 = $31,496/year

Cost vs Savings:
- AI cost: $300/month √ó 12 = $3,600/year
- Net benefit: $31,496 - $3,600 = $27,896/year
- ROI: 775%
```

| Sales | Salesforce Einstein | $50/user | $15,000/user |

#### **Cost Analysis Framework**

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):**
```
TCO = Software Cost + Training Cost + Implementation Cost + Maintenance Cost

Example:
- Software: $20/month √ó 100 users = $24,000/year
- Training: $50/user √ó 100 users = $5,000 one-time
- Implementation: $10,000 one-time
- Maintenance: $2,000/year

Year 1 TCO: $41,000
Annual TCO (Year 2+): $26,000
