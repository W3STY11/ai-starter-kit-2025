## 🎯 Core Safety Principles

### The Five Pillars of AI Safety

1. **Privacy First**: Never share sensitive personal or organizational data
2. **Verify Always**: Fact-check important information from AI
3. **Human Oversight**: Keep humans in the loop for critical decisions
4. **Ethical Use**: Use AI to help, not harm
5. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on AI capabilities and risks

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

### Never Share with AI:

#### Personal Information
- ❌ Social Security Numbers
- ❌ Credit card or bank details
- ❌ Passwords or PINs
- ❌ Home addresses

- ❌ Private photos

#### Business Information
- ❌ Trade secrets
- ❌ Proprietary code
- ❌ Customer data
- ❌ Financial records

### Safe Sharing Practices

✅ **Use Anonymization**:
```
Instead of: "John Smith at 123 Main St needs help with his $50,000 debt"
Use: "A person needs help with significant debt"
```

✅ **Create Generic Examples**:
```
Instead of: Uploading actual customer data
Use: Create sample data that represents the structure
```

✅ **Remove Identifiers**:
```
Before sharing documents:
- Remove names, addresses, phone numbers
- Replace with [NAME], [ADDRESS], [PHONE]
- Use generic company names
```
