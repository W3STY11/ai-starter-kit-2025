## üîë The Basics

### The Golden Rule
**Be specific, provide context, and state your desired outcome clearly.**

### Basic Prompt Structure
```
[Context] + [Task] + [Constraints] + [Format]
```

**Example**:
```
I'm a marketing manager [context] writing a product launch email [task]. 
Keep it under 200 words and use a friendly but professional tone [constraints]. 
Format it with a subject line, greeting, 3 body paragraphs, and CTA [format].
```

### Five Essential Elements

#### 1. **Context** - Set the scene
- Your role/situation
- Background information
- Relevant constraints

#### 2. **Task** - Be specific
- What you want done
- Clear action verbs
- Measurable outcomes

#### 3. **Format** - Define the output
- Structure required
- Length constraints
- Style preferences

#### 4. **Examples** - Show don't tell
- Provide samples
- Reference formats
- Demonstrate tone

#### 5. **Constraints** - Set boundaries
- Word/time limits
- Dos and don'ts
- Required elements

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### 1. Role-Playing
**Make AI adopt a specific persona**
```
Act as an experienced financial advisor with 20 years of experience helping young professionals. Explain investment basics to a 25-year-old with $5,000 to invest for the first time.
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought
**Request step-by-step reasoning**
```
Walk me through your thinking step-by-step as you solve this problem: How can a small bakery increase revenue by 20% in 6 months without raising prices?
```

### 3. Few-Shot Learning
**Provide examples of desired output**
```
Convert these sentences to active voice:
- Passive: The report was written by the team
- Active: The team wrote the report

Now convert: The decision was made by management
```

### 4. Iterative Refinement
**Build on previous responses**
```
Initial: Create a tagline for an eco-friendly water bottle
Refine: Make it more playful and under 5 words
Refine: Add alliteration
Final: "Sip Sustainably, Save Smartly!"
```

### 5. Constraint Layering
**Add constraints progressively**
```
Write a story about a robot.
‚Üí Make it 100 words exactly.
‚Üí Include the words "butterfly" and "quantum".
‚Üí End with a plot twist.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Specific Tips

### ChatGPT
- Use "Continue" for longer responses
- Reference previous messages: "In your last response..."
- Request specific GPT-4 features: "Generate an image of..."

- Use Projects for persistent context
- Ask for ethical considerations

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### 1. Being Too Vague

### 2. Information Overload
‚ùå [500 words of background before the question]
‚úÖ "Context: I run a small bakery. Task: Create a loyalty program that encourages repeat visits."

### 3. No Format Specification
‚ùå "Give me social media ideas"
‚úÖ "List 5 Instagram post ideas for a fitness brand, each with a caption (50 words) and relevant hashtags"

### 4. Assuming AI Knowledge
‚ùå "Write like that author I mentioned"
‚úÖ "Write in the style of Ernest Hemingway: short sentences, simple words, powerful imagery"

### 5. Single-Shot Expecting Perfection
‚ùå [Give up after first response]
‚úÖ "Good start. Now make it more conversational and add a personal anecdote"
