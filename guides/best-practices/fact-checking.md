## üéØ Why Fact-Checking Matters

### AI Limitations to Remember

1. **Training Data Cutoff**: AI knowledge has a specific date limit
2. **Hallucinations**: AI can confidently state false information
3. **Bias Reflection**: AI mirrors biases in training data
4. **Context Confusion**: AI may mix up similar concepts
5. **Statistical Fabrication**: Numbers and dates often need verification

### The Cost of Not Fact-Checking

- üíº **Professional**: Damaged credibility, lost clients
- üìö **Academic**: Failed assignments, academic penalties
- üí∞ **Financial**: Poor decisions based on wrong data
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal**: Liability for spreading misinformation
- üè• **Health**: Dangerous if medical info is wrong

## üö® Common AI Errors

### 1. Date and Time Errors
**What to Watch**: 
- Historical dates
- Recent events
- Future predictions
- Timeline sequences

**Example**:
```
AI says: "The iPhone was first released in 2008"
Reality: iPhone was released in 2007
```

### 2. Statistical Mistakes
**What to Watch**:
- Percentages and ratios
- Population figures
- Financial data
- Scientific measurements

**Example**:
```
AI says: "90% of startups fail in the first year"
Reality: About 20% fail in the first year, 90% within 10 years
```

### 3. Attribution Errors
**What to Watch**:
- Quotes and citations
- Author credits
- Source materials
- Research findings

**Example**:
```
AI says: "Einstein said 'Insanity is doing the same thing...'"
Reality: This quote has no verified connection to Einstein
```

### 4. Technical Inaccuracies
**What to Watch**:
- Code syntax
- Scientific formulas
- Technical specifications
- Process descriptions

### 5. Current Events
**What to Watch**:
